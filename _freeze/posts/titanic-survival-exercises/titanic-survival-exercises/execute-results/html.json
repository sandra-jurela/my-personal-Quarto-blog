So I decided to put all my new skills together to perform exploratory data analysis on a classic machine learning dataset: Titanic survival! My goal is to provide answers entirely through visualizations.\n\n## Background\n\nThe Titanic was a British ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 from the United Kingdom to New York. More than 1,500 of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died in the accident, making this one of the largest maritime disasters ever outside of war. The ship carried a wide range of passengers of all ages and both genders, from luxury travelers in first-class to immigrants in the lower classes. However, not all passengers were equally likely to survive the accident. We use real data about a selection of 891 passengers to learn who was on the Titanic and which passengers were more likely to survive.\n\n## Libraries, Customizations, and Data\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(titanic)\n\noptions(digits = 3)  \ntheme_set(theme_classic())\ncolors_sex <- c(\"mediumorchid1\", \"dodgerblue\")\ncolors_survived <- c(\"gray65\", \"lightgreen\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nDefining the `titanic` dataset.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic <- titanic_train %>%\n  select(Survived, Pclass, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare) %>%\n  mutate(Survived = factor(Survived),\n         Pclass = factor(Pclass),\n         Sex = factor(Sex))\n\nhead(titanic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Survived Pclass    Sex Age SibSp Parch  Fare\n1        0      3   male  22     1     0  7.25\n2        1      1 female  38     1     0 71.28\n3        1      3 female  26     0     0  7.92\n4        1      1 female  35     1     0 53.10\n5        0      3   male  35     0     0  8.05\n6        0      3   male  NA     0     0  8.46\n```\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(titanic)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n'data.frame':\t891 obs. of  7 variables:\n $ Survived: Factor w/ 2 levels \"0\",\"1\": 1 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 ...\n $ Pclass  : Factor w/ 3 levels \"1\",\"2\",\"3\": 3 1 3 1 3 3 1 3 3 2 ...\n $ Sex     : Factor w/ 2 levels \"female\",\"male\": 2 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 ...\n $ Age     : num  22 38 26 35 35 NA 54 2 27 14 ...\n $ SibSp   : int  1 1 0 1 0 0 0 3 0 1 ...\n $ Parch   : int  0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 2 0 ...\n $ Fare    : num  7.25 71.28 7.92 53.1 8.05 ...\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n## Question 1: Variable Types\n\nInstructions: Inspect the data and also use `?titanic_train` to learn more about the variables in the dataset. Match these variables from the dataset to their variable type. There is at least one variable of each type (ordinal categorical, non-ordinal (nominal) categorical, continuous, discrete).\n\nChecking if `Age` variable is discrete or continuous...\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nunique(titanic$Age)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n [1] 22.00 38.00 26.00 35.00    NA 54.00  2.00 27.00 14.00  4.00 58.00 20.00\n[13] 39.00 55.00 31.00 34.00 15.00 28.00  8.00 19.00 40.00 66.00 42.00 21.00\n[25] 18.00  3.00  7.00 49.00 29.00 65.00 28.50  5.00 11.00 45.00 17.00 32.00\n[37] 16.00 25.00  0.83 30.00 33.00 23.00 24.00 46.00 59.00 71.00 37.00 47.00\n[49] 14.50 70.50 32.50 12.00  9.00 36.50 51.00 55.50 40.50 44.00  1.00 61.00\n[61] 56.00 50.00 36.00 45.50 20.50 62.00 41.00 52.00 63.00 23.50  0.92 43.00\n[73] 60.00 10.00 64.00 13.00 48.00  0.75 53.00 57.00 80.00 70.00 24.50  6.00\n[85]  0.67 30.50  0.42 34.50 74.00\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\n`Age` is a continuous variable.\n\n| Variable   | Description                       | Variable Type       |\n|------------|-----------------------------------|---------------------|\n| `Survived` | Passenger Survival Indicator      | nominal categorical |\n| `Pclass`   | Passenger Class                   | ordinal categorical |\n| `Sex`      | Sex                               | nominal categorical |\n| `Age`      | Age                               | continuous          |\n| `SibSp`    | Number of Siblings/Spouses Aboard | discrete            |\n| `Parch`    | Number of Parents/Children Aboard | discrete            |\n| `Fare`     | Passenger Fare                    | continuous          |\n\n## Question 2: Demographics of Titanic Passengers\n\nInstructions: Make density plots of age grouped by sex.

Make three barplots. For the first, make a basic barplot of passenger class filled by survival. For the second, make the same barplot but use the argument `position = position_fill()` to show relative proportions in each group instead of counts. For the third, make a barplot of survival filled by passenger class using `position = position_fill()`\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Pclass)) + \n  geom_bar(width = 0.7) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = \"count\", vjust = -1) +\n  expand_limits(y = 530) +\n  ylab(\"count\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) + \n  geom_bar(width = 0.7, position = position_fill(), color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_survived)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Pclass, fill = Survived)) + \n  geom_bar(width = 0.8, position = position_dodge(0.85)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_survived)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-17-1.png){width=480}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Survived, fill = Pclass)) + \n  geom_bar(width = 0.7, position = position_fill(), color = \"white\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png){width=384}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich of the following are true?\n\nSelect all correct answers.\n\n-   ✅ There were more third class passengers than passengers in the first two classes combined.\n-   ❌ There were the fewest passengers in first class, second-most passengers in second class, and most passengers in third class.\n-   ✅ Survival proportion was highest for first class passengers, followed by second class.

Most passengers in other classes did not survive.\n-   ❌ The majority of survivors were from first class.\n-   ✅ The majority of those who did not survive were from third class.\n\n## Question 8: Survival by Age, Sex and Passenger Class\n\nInstructions: Create a grid of density plots for age, filled by survival status, with count on the y-axis, faceted by sex and passenger class.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Age, ..count.., fill = Pclass)) +\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5) \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-19-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntitanic %>% \n  ggplot(aes(Age, ..count.., fill = Survived)) +\n  geom_density(alpha=0.5) +\n  facet_grid((Sex ~ Pclass)) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = colors_survived) + \n  theme(panel.border = element_rect(colour = \"black\", fill = NA)) +\n  theme(legend.position = \"top\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](titanic-survival-exercises_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-20-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhich of the following are true?\n\nSelect all correct answers.\n\n-   ✅ The largest group of passengers was third-class males.\n-   ❌ The age distribution is the same across passenger classes.\n-   ❌ The gender distribution is the same across passenger classes.\n-   ✅ Most first-class and second-class females survived.\n-   ✅ Almost all second-class males did not survive, with the exception of children.\n\n<br/>\n\nThat's all.
