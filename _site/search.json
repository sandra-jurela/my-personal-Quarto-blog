Recently I have developed a real passion for Data Science and this blog truly is a manifestation of that.\nI hold a Master’s degree in Civil Engineering (Hydrology and Water Resources Science). I started my career as a construction designer, and then for 10 years worked as a hydrologist at the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service. I currently work for my family’s business.\nI live in Zagreb, Croatia, with my two boys (life partner and our sweet son).\nIf you’d like to connect with me, please do. I hope you enjoy your visit!"

    "text": "Background\nThe Titanic was a British ocean liner that struck an iceberg and sunk on its maiden voyage in 1912 from the United Kingdom to New York. More than 1,500 of the estimated 2,224 passengers and crew died in the accident, making this one of the largest maritime disasters ever outside of war. The ship carried a wide range of passengers of all ages and both genders, from luxury travelers in first-class to immigrants in the lower classes. However, not all passengers were equally likely to survive the accident. We use real data about a selection of 891 passengers to learn who was on the Titanic and which passengers were more likely to survive."
