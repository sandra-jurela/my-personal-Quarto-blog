Hi and welcome to my personal blog. My name is Sandra Jurela and here I will be sharing my journey into Data Science. Recently I have developed a real passion for Data Science and this blog truly is a manifestation of that.

I hold a Master's degree in Civil Engineering (Hydrology and Water Resources Science). I started my career as a construction designer, and then for 10 years worked as a hydrologist at the Croatian Meteorological and Hydrological Service. I currently work for my family's business.

I live in Zagreb, Croatia, with my two boys (life partner and our sweet son).

If you'd like to connect with me, please do. I hope you enjoy your visit!
